Have you also heard of 12-year-old kids creating [pixelated whales](https://opensea.io/collection/weirdwhales) and becoming millionaires overnight? Do you want to do the same thing and enjoy the rest of your days with Big Luca in Dubai blossoming dompe and posting stories with #goodbyePoor ???

Then this is the perfect guide to launching your first NFT collection, and
if you strike out, remember to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/lukapetro) ðŸ˜Š

## What are we talking about?

Good question!!! NFT stands for **NOT FUNGIBLE TOKEN**.

_"Okay thanks, but even the walls know that"_.

True, so here's an example: let's take Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. There are millions of copies of this painting in the world, but only 1 is the original. This is an NFT, which is a unique good.
Going back to the NFTs we have on the web, we can see them as certificates of ownership.

_"Whatever but so how do you create an NFT?"_

Here is the shopping list:

1. [Artwork](/blog)
   1. Create the layers
   2. Combine the layers
2. [Nerd Stuff](/blog).
   1. Complexity of minting
   2. Smart contracting
   3. IPFS + metadata
   4. 10,000 NFTs!!!
3. [Making the big money](/blog)
   1. Wallet
   2. Uploading to OpenSea
   3. Giveaways

Let's go over how to create your first NFT collection by following what I did, step by step. I will guide you hand by hand!!

## Conclusion.

My thoughts on this technology are contradictory.

On the one hand, I see real utility in several areas where indeed the token excels, example: medical records and files, real estate, intellectual property and patents, voting, ticketing etc..

You also hear a lot lately about [NFT Soulbound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html): basically they are NFTs that cannot be traded. They just belong to that subject. Imagine the school diploma. It makes sense that it is tied to a person, is unique and non-transferable. Use case **perfect**.

The other side of the coin is the enormous speculation around it. In 2021, an estimated $27 billion is estimated to be invested in the market. Exuberance, compulsive buying, hype and [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) play a key role here.

If you are also prone to making such reckless choices, I invite you to check out the topic on [personal finance](/blog).

I would like to thank [@LuciaTalamonti](https://read.cv/luciatalamonti) for helping me with the design of the collection. It was really a lot of fun!!!
