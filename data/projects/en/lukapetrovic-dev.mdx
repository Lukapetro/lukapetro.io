[lukapetrovic.dev](https://www.lukapetrovic.dev/) wants to be my personal space in the infinite web.
Here I'll tell about the projects I develop, about my life and maybe some articles in the tech world.

## The 5 Ws (and 1 H)

The [**Five Ws and one H**](https://www.workfront.com/blog/project-management-101-the-5-ws-and-1-h-that-should-be-asked-of-every-project) are questions whose answers are considered basic in information-gathering.
They constitute a formula for getting the complete story on a subject.

So without further ado, here we go:

- **Who**: well no doubt it's about me üòé
- **What**: as obvious as it is, the purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my technical skills, projects I've contributed to and a bit of my personal life
- **When**: this portfolio was born in 2017. At the end of 2021 I decided to give it a more modern and fresh look ( as we will see in the [tech stack](/projects/lukapetrovic#tech-stack))
  and I recreated the entire web page with the intention of maintaining it over time without an expiration date
- **Where**: üåé
- **Why**: well mainly it's to avoid answering always the same questions like: what technologies do you work with? what projects have you developed? etc.. I simply send the link and woil√†, the game is done
- **How**: TLDR [React](https://reactjs.org/). All details in the section below ‚¨áÔ∏è

## Tech Stack

This portfolio initially created in 2017 was born with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

After deciding I wanted to start from scratch and having followed the evolution of react frameworks,
the decision came by itself. Here is how I developed the whole thing:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://prisma.io/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- **Content**: [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Overview

In the image above we see the folder structure of the project. Looking at it in detail here is what we find:

- `data/*` - MDX data that is used for projects and blog posts.
- `layouts` - The different page layouts each MDX category uses.
- `utils` - A collection of helpful utilities or code for external services.
- `pages/api/*` - [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) powering project views.
- `pages/projects` - [Personal projects](https://www.lukapetrovic.dev/projects).
- `pages/*` - All other static pages.
- `prisma/*` - My Prisma schema, which uses a PlanetScale MySQL database.
- `public/*` - Static assets including fonts and images.
- `styles/*` - A small amount of global styles. I'm mostly using vanilla Tailwind CSS.

## Snippets

Some code snippets that may be of interest.

Many of the contents of this portfolio are mdx files; To render a mdx content i used the [Contentlayer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentlayer) library.
Contentlayer turns your content into data - making it super easy to import MD(X) and CMS content in your app.

```jsx
const { withContentlayer } = require('next-contentlayer');

module.exports = withContentlayer()({
  // Your Next.js config...
});
```

Once we know how to properly render MD(X) content, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by
[getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props).

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {} // will be passed to the page component as props
  };
}
```

Another interesting feature is the count of project views.

To do this I used [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) + [SWR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr).
Here is an example of how the ViewCounter works.

```jsx
export default function ViewCounter({ slug }) {
  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/views/${slug}`, fetcher);
  const views = new Number(data?.total);

  useEffect(() => {
    const registerView = () =>
      fetch(`/api/views/${slug}`, {
        method: 'POST'
      });

    registerView();
  }, [slug]);

  return <span>{`${views > 0 ? views.toLocaleString() : '‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì'} views`}</span>;
}
```

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun developing this portfolio. I've been wanting to do something with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quite some time, so I jumped at the chance.

If you like the project I leave attached the link to the Github repo, you can clone/fork it, just make sure to remove all my personal data üòù
