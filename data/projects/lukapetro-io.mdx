## What is Gymless?

A few days after the news of the Covid emergency and consequently of the closed gyms, a friend of mine who was a personal trainer,
[Davide](https://www.instagram.com/davidegattitrainer/), contacted some of his clients for a special class out of town,
precisely in the City Life neighborhood of Milan.

All it took was a bit of word of mouth to bring many gym lovers to the classes
organized by Gymless, and overnight they created groups of more than 30 people eager to resume their daily workouts.

## From Gym to Gymless

Due to strong demand, Gymless was born. Groups of people training in the open air in a format where you alternate between grounded
and cardio phases and enjoy the open spaces the city is rich in.

To organize this, I developed a management-style web app where trainers can
create workout classes and enrolled users can sign up.

## Tech Stack

The technology stack that I have chosen for the development of gymless is:

- [React](https://it.reactjs.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/it/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Frontend

As mentioned in the technology stack, I used [react](https://it.reactjs.org/) for frontend development.
For the application state management I decided to use [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
since I opted to use a server with [graphQL](https://graphql.org/). [Material UI](https://mui.com/) was my pick as the UI
library for React components.

The frontend is divided into 2 macro-sections:

- **Admin section**

  The admin section allowed trainers to create, edit and delete workouts. Through a dashboard they had a generic overview
  of the progress of the various classes and the number of registered users. They also had access to the archive of past classes,
  where they could view all the data related to that workout.

- **User section**

  The user section allowed the registration to the created classes.
  To enroll it was necessary to pay an entrance fee. The payment flow was managed with [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/)
  or with credit card through the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/).

## Backend

As mentioned in the previous section, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/it/) with Graphql was the main choice for the backend. In its first version Gymless
was a simple online booking application, with scaling and evolution capabilities.
The choice was made keeping this possibility in mind and knowing the advantages offered by this architecture:

- Good fit for complex systems and microservices
- Fetching data with a single API call.
- No over- and under-fetching problems.
- Tailoring requests to your needs.
- API evolution without versioning.
- Rapid application prototyping.

> Note: the project needed to be out in the market as soon as possible, and this stack allowed to develop a prototype application very quickly.

### Libraries worth mentioning

Here are some of the libraries used for development:

- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
  is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client

- [Bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
  used for storing passwords as hashed passwords instead of plaintext.

```jsx
var salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(10);
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync('B4c0//', salt);
```

- [Jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) -
  An open standard used to share security information between two parties ‚Äî a client and a server

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) -
  Service API that allows developers to accept payments online.

```js
const stripe = require('stripe')('secret_key');

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 2000,
  currency: 'usd',
  payment_method_types: ['card']
});
```

- [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) is authentication middleware for Node.js. Mainly used for Facebook-strategy.

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Node.js and TypeScript ORM

  Here is a simple example of how a table was structured in the DB

```js
model User {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email      String   @unique
  name       String?
  workouts   Workout[]?
}
```

## Dev Ops

To deploy the application I used 3 different platforms:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the client.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the server.
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/it/rds/postgresql/) for the database.

The pipeline included 3 main environments:

1. Development
2. Test
3. Production

## Conclusion

Create gymless was a great experience. For the first time alone I found myself managing all aspects of
the application lifecycle, from choosing the technology stack, to interface design and db schema definition,
to testing and deployment.

I vividly remember the moments before the live release and the announcement on the Instagram page, a unique mix of
emotions. Seeing users register and book classes without bugs or crashes was the most satisfying thing üòç.

All developed code is public in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/Lukapetro/gymless-server).
