It was 2017 when [Simone](https://www.instagram.com/simone_fedi) started a master thesis project in finance on the professional use of Copy-Trading.
The results were amazing, so much so that he decided to invest his savings in it.

## What is Twin Yield?

Twin Yield is an algorithm. Unlike the usual investment funds where portfolios made up of assets and stocks are built, twin yield builds a people-based portfolio.

By analyzing huge amounts of traders (returns, risks, statistics, correlations etc...) and cross-referencing the data,
investment portfolios are generated based on them.

The skimming is done on several levels, going to refine the list of possible "good" traders with a top-down approach.

Finally, after giving the algorithm the traders' data, the investment portfolio is generated, and through the [copy-trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_trading) functionality,
the trades of the promoted traders are copied 1-1.

## Let's shoot some numbers

I currently have to obscure this part, as the project is evolving rapidly and I am not allowed to share such data for now.

## Tech Stack

Currently twin yield has an administrator interface where data collection operations are performed and analyses are launched.
Obviously most of the work is done on the backend, from data collection, to processing and filtering and then being fed to the algorithm.

To set up this structure the technology stack is:

- [React](https://it.reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/it/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Let's see in detail frontend and backend in the next paragraphs.

## Frontend

  />
</a>

> The image above has fake data. Real data are private.

[React](https://it.reactjs.org/) has been used as a library for GUI development.
The operations performed on the admin interface are currently carried out on a weekly basis,
which does not require any particular state management requirements.

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) was another addition to this project. Working with a huge amount of data,
it becomes critical type-checking the data to ensure it is correct.

### FE Libraries

- [Chakra Ui](https://chakra-ui.com/)
  is a simple, modular and accessible component library.

- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
  open source production-ready motion library for bringing some animations.

  Here is a custom spinner made with this amazing library:

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <motion.div
    animate={{
      scale: [1, 2, 2, 1, 1],
      rotate: [0, 0, 270, 270, 0],
      borderRadius: ['20%', '20%', '50%', '50%', '20%']
    }}
  />
);
```

- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
  for fetching, caching and updating data.

```jsx
export function useGetAnalysis() {
  const axios = useAxios();

  return useQuery('analysis', async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.get('/analysis');
    return data;
  });
}
```

## Backend

The heart of twin yield resides in the backend. We can divide the backend into 2 distinct sections:

- Bot: scheduled periodically to retrieve updated data. If the job fails for any reason, an emailed report is generated with details.
  If, on the other hand, the data recovery is successful, it is inserted into the database.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/it/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the server: here the data is retrieved from
  the database and processed and then fed to the algorithm.

### BE Libraries

The list of the libraries to use is quite articulated, I quote the 5 that I consider most important and key for the project:

- [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.

- [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) a fast & flexible implementation of jQuery designed specifically for the server.

```jsx
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const $ = cheerio.load('<h2 class="title">Hello world</h2>');

$('h2.title').text('Hello there!');
```

- [Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi) powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.

```jsx
const Joi = require('joi');

const schema = Joi.object({
  username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required()
});
```

- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) that provide a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

```jsx
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test');

const Cat = mongoose.model('Cat', { name: String });

const kitty = new Cat({ name: 'Zildjian' });
kitty.save().then(() => console.log('meow'));
```

- [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) as a logger for just about everything.

## Dev Ops

To deploy the application I used 3 different platforms:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the client.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the server.
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) for the database.

## Conclusion

Twin yield is a unique project. The challenges faced in building the [data scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) bot were not easy,
and when things get difficult I can give it my best shot ðŸ˜Ž

Everything is working for the moment, but this project has become like a game of cat and mouse, and sometimes you're the cat, sometimes you're the mouse.

The code repo is private, as I am not the sole owner of the algorithms used and I was not given consent to share it.
