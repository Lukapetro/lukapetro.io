Inspired by [others](https://uses.tech/), Iâ€™ve listed the hardware and software that I use daily to get work done.

## Table of Contents

3.  [Custom Keyboard](/uses/#custom-keyboard)

## Software

I use a variety of Software. Professionally, I prefer to work with the Apple ecosystem.
However, I also dabble in other platforms for fun.

- [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) â€“ My primary OS.

### Apps

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/it_it/chrome/) to navigate and develop
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My go-to editor
- [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) as terminal
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - ðŸ˜’

## Hardware

- 2019 Macbook Pro 13
- 2x [Monitor](https://amzn.to/3rkXb0j) - 27" FULL HD LED IPS
- [Logitech G903 LIGHTSPEED](https://amzn.to/37q1FLV)
- [Belkin BoostCharge PRO](https://amzn.to/3rngNB7) wireless charger with MagSafe for my devices
- [BONTEC Monitor Arm](https://amzn.to/3ghY8Af) to keep the 2 monitors

### Custom Keyboard

Fixed on youtube videos of custom mechanical keyboards I decided to make one too ( and I don't think it will be the last ðŸ˜… ).
Here is my first build:

- [Keychron K6](https://amzn.to/3KRQhHm) for the Case, PCB and plate.
- [Gateron MX red](https://amzn.to/3EpH5aS) switches.
- [Sunzit Keycaps](https://amzn.to/3uNPwcy) for keycaps.

And here is the final result:
