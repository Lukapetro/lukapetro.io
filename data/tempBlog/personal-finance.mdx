The year 2022 has started in a crazy way for me. After several selection processes and interviews with many companies,
I finally found what I can call my new challenge and adventure, or rather say my new challengeS.

Working simultaneously for more than one client is not easy; it requires a lot of organization, excellent time management skills,
stress and workload management, and above all, a lot of productivity. Of course, I had none of that initially, but it was a huge opportunity for growth in that respect.
Then again, getting out of one's comfort zone allows us to grow both technically and personally.

Obviously working for more than one client full-time requires a lot of time (forget about doing the "classic" 8h daily),
but it also implies a conspicuous increase from an economic point of view.

Now that's the whole point, after the first month of settling in, the first enacted invoices are paid,
and out of the blue you get not just the classic monthly salary, but 2! Yay now I can spend it all buying new clothes and going to parties.
Well no. Or at least, if you have any brains at all you understand that it is not the smartest thing to do.

So what alternatives do I have but to spend money? Well, I realized that my financial knowledge and education is equal to that of a 3-year-old child: I know nothing about it.

What should I do to best manage my capital? Should I leave the money in the bank? Or are banks a scam and am I better off leaving it under the mattress? Should I invest?
If yes in what? There is a lot of talk about crypto today, maybe I do 100x tonight. What if I gamble them on roulette instead to try to multiply them?

I had 10 thousand questions in my head, and to this day I don't know if there is a right answer to the question how best to manage capital,
but I found MY answer to this question. Are you curious about what I figured out? Read on then :)

After this rather long introduction, let's go and see what I want to talk to you about in this article:
