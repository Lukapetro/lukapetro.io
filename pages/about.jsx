          Hi, I'm Luka. I am a fullstack developer. Currently I work at FACEIT
          as a Senior Software Engineer. I Also collaborate as a freelancer with
          Playtomic and BeConcept Studio.

          I grew up in San Benedetto del Tronto and did computer engineering at
          UNIVPM. In my free time I like to work out, play some video games and
          spend time with my wolfdog, Blue üê∫.
